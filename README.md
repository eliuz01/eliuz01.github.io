## Projects
**Student Pick-up and Drop Alert API**
 - This system allows notifications to be sent to students when a bus is approaching their pickup or dropoff location. The notifications are generated based on the bus's current location and its speed. If the bus is within a 5-minute radius of the studentâ€™s location, a notification is generated. I opted for the Haversine formula for distance calculation after facing challenges with configuring PostgreSQL with PostGIS (a spatial database extension for PostgreSQL) to handle geographic data for distance calculations.

***Key Features***
- Distance Calculation: The system uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the bus and the student's pickup or dropoff location.
- Notification Message: If the bus is within 5 minutes of the student's location, a notification is generated with details about the distance and time remaining to the pickup or dropoff location.
- Customizable Speed: The bus speed is configurable to adjust the time and distance calculations.
