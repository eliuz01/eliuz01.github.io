## Projects
**Student Pick-up and Drop Alert API**[here](https://github.com/eliuz01/ALX_Capstone_Project.git)
 - This system allows notifications to be sent to students when a bus is approaching their pickup or dropoff location. The notifications are generated based on the bus's current location and its speed. If the bus is within a 5-minute radius of the student’s location, a notification is generated. I opted for the Haversine formula for distance calculation after facing challenges with configuring PostgreSQL with PostGIS (a spatial database extension for PostgreSQL) to handle geographic data for distance calculations.

***Key Features***
- Distance Calculation: The system uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the bus and the student's pickup or dropoff location.
- Notification Message: If the bus is within 5 minutes of the student's location, a notification is generated with details about the distance and time remaining to the pickup or dropoff location.
- Customizable Speed: The bus speed is configurable to adjust the time and distance calculations.

The flow covers browsing, cart creation, checkout, payment confirmation, and order status updates from Pending to Paid, Shipped, or Cancelled.
